##WOPA: The journey. 

Every day that I walk into Outbox for one of my WOPA classes, I am reminded of how fast our time there is running out. It’s quite sad really. And that’s because it has been and still is an amazing journey that has greatly superseded even my expectations.


##WOPA: Week one
Week one was amazing. Getting to know everyone on the team was so much fun. At first I was scared of what it would be like for me as one of the youngest students there. However, getting to know everyone dispelled those fears. This week showed us how diverse we all were on this program, but the most beautiful part is our ability to work as a unit. It rocks


##WOPA: Week two
This will forever be one of my favorite weeks on the program. It was self discovery week. During this week we learnt about leadership, how to make our mission statement and visions. I was greatly inspired by the speaker and all the material we shared; the videos and audios. After this week, I felt like a changed woman.


##WOPA: Week three ++
The rest of the weeks of the program have been taken up learning some really cool stuff. The business part and programming in python is all very exciting. Every day brings its own surprises and lessons, something I look forward to each week. The program has been wholesome for me and I look forward to the weeks to come.
