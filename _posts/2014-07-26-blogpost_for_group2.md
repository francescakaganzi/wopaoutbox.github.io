##TEN MINUTES


I can hear explosions as I write this. They are so close, the furniture rattles and the lamps shake. There’s talk of a ceasefire, but it doesn’t feel like it here. I am living in a horror movie. At least we’re alive. The park behind our apartment building was bombed and the explosion rocked the whole area. The noise was deafening. There isn’t a single street in Kampala that’s safe.

I don't know how long this will go on or how long I can keep this up.I don't want to run forever, but then again where would I run to. 
No one seems to be bothered about what's going on. You'd think that the leaders of this country would be able to protect their citizens. It's too loud, the noise is deafening.Only God can protect us now. 
I have lives to protect. My little sister is only 8 and my brother 6. 
All I can do now is fight for myself, and fight for those  I love.
