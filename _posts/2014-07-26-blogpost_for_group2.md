##TEN MINUTES


I can hear explosions as I write this. They are so close, the furniture rattles and the lamps shake. There’s talk of a ceasefire, but it doesn’t feel like it here. I am living in a horror movie. At least we’re alive. The park behind our apartment building was bombed and the explosion rocked the whole area. The noise was deafening. There isn’t a single street in Kampala that’s safe.

I don't know how long this will go on or how long I can keep this up.I don't want to run forever, but then again where would I run to. 
No one seems to be bothered about what's going on. You'd think that the leaders of this country would be able to protect their citizens. It's too loud, the noise is deafening.Only God can protect us now. 
I have lives to protect. My little sister is only 8 and my brother 6. 
All I can do now is fight for myself, and fight for those  I love. 

This must be a dream,a terrible dream, a nightmare. It was just last month when we were all so peaceful,lived with our parents as one big happy family. But now,we are left without parental love,without care,homeless trekking night after night simply looking for whatever shelter we can get, all in the name of power struggle. 
May God help us,may He help this nation.

Now-a-days insecurity can be seen everywhere. It is like cancer in public life, which has not become so rampant and perpetuated overnight, but in course of time. What is even more frightening is that the principles of international law and the tools of multilateral action which could protect us from these attacks are being undermined, marginalized or destroyed by powerful governments.
