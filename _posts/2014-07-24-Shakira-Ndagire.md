                 ### MY EXPERIENCE AT WOPA
After applying, attempting a coding challenge and having an interview, i was chosen among the 25 ladies to participate in the first cohort of the Women Passion Program.
I have been able to work with awesome ladies from various fields and walks of life.I have really attained exposure to what is out of the class room and got a glimps of
what i am venturing in career wise.

In the First week, I was excited about the training and meeting the other participants.After the introductions(Providing information about oneself) and the Life map
(Entire life's journey) sessions,I got acquinted to the participants and felt at home during the trainings.

In the second week,we had leadership training by Mr. Micheal Nyitegeka, which helped me look at life from a different perspective,dwell on what i can change(Future) and,
understand my self better by discoveringmy strengths,weaknesses and passion.This enabled me figure out the direction i want to take in life.

From the Third week to the present day,we are having business and technical sessions interchangeably,I find this great because i would like to be "A Developer with
Business Analysis skills".
For the business sessions,we are using Human Centered Design to come up with a solution for St.Bruno ladies.This made me think of how i was coming up with applications
but from my perspective not the customers,which is an improper parctice since they are the system users.

For the Technical sessions,I am learning a totally new programming language which I find interesting and challenging at the same time.This is because it is new, though
I believe with instructor's guidance and my efforts i will be able to improve on my programming skills.

I am looking forward to more sessions.
