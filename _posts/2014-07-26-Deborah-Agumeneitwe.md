# The people at Outbox
I first heard about outbox while i was looking for an internship placement. The training started 10th June and thats when i met all these *AMAZING* people...hmm...I was challenged to become better in all that i do,and am still striving to do so. Not easy tho,i must say....


## Business Sessions
Eh,business analysts are strong people. It requires alot of patience,and i believe i have become more analytical,paying attention to the tiniest detail because any information is mportant.still learning....

## Technical Sessions
Now these are something. I did not know how to do/hand in assignments on my own until i joined the technical class. They have helped me push myself,get out of my comfort/lazy zone,learning all these new things;python,github and wow, the struggle continues...... 

###### All in all,am greatful for this wopa experience:-)
