####THE WOMEN PASSION PROGRAM(WOPA)
 Enrolling for WOPA is one of great achievements for this year.the program commenced on 10th June 2014.
##### First Week
Introduction week: I got to know all the ladies because we had name tags and everyone had an opportunity to introduce themselves more(details).
After the LIFEMAP sessions, i felt more comfortable and welcome although I was challenged by people's profile and learnt alot from their experiences.

##### Second week
This week was very Awesome , it was a leadership training week with personal discovery, leading self, leadership mindset and strategic positioning.
i had to dig deeper within me and discover my passion, get a circle of influence and focus on the future that i can easily influence more than the past.

##### Third week- update
currently its business and Tech classes:
under Business, we are working hard to come up with a solution to improve the income of women from low income families involved in crafts within Uganda.
This has enable me learn how to collaborate and participate in teamwork and also again business analysis skills.
i have learnt alot from my Group (B).
under Tech classes; Every day  i learn new concepts which is good although coming up with running code challenging.
