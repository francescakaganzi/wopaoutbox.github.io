## The WOPA training. 

It felt great... Being chosen out of many ladies to be part of the first Women Passion program class after the coding challenge and it interview. I became apart of a simply amazing group of people

### Going through the Motions.

10th - 13th June
Week 1 of class was about getting to know the other ladies who they are, where they have been and what makes them the people they are now using life maps. I must say it was humbling i said to my self 'Lillian you've got to do more' every body had something special in their story...
 
I like that we were allowed to express creativity, the map had visuals and cartoons the ladies kept things pretty interesting on the flip chart.

Going through my life maps was like watching an really old movie i had long forgotten but it got me thinking i can do more.. But mostly asked my self if am in the right place .
