			## My WOPA Experience
Several weeks ago, i was excited and privileged to be part of the first cohort of the WOPA program. The first two weeks were not just getting to know each other but they gave me a chance to dig deeper into knowing who I am. I actually discovered who I didn't know I was. After sharing with these awesom ladies and listening to what they had to say, it was much easier interacting with them. So far it hasn't happened anywhere i have been but I really love the fact that we were given time to know each other.

Then came the business classes. Business has never been my thing but for some reason I picked interest. I began appreciating its relevance after the empathy maps and I would love to dig deeper after the WOPA program. 
An ancient Persian poet once said: "If thou hast two pennies, spend one on bread. With the other, buy hyacinths for thy soul."
Poetry, yes, but good common sense as well.
To buy "hyacinths" for the soul ? â€“means to nourish your mind and heart with good reading; to become informed, alert, interested in what others say to you, and to be interesting in what you say to others -- it's just as important as progress in your business, personal or social life. 

My long awaited, 'the technical classes'. Lynn and Remo, you've been the coolest programming instructors. The passion and zeal of my fellow learners was and is still very encouraging and motivating. They have been so helpful in understanding the concepts of programming. I believe ladies can be techies and design solutions for the world . They only need to be resolute and resilient not to give up even when they have every reason to.

WOPA has been more than programming and doing businness. It has been a real life, learning and thrilling experience. I believe I have been equipped to impact the ladies within my area of influence. Big thanks to the facilitators, job well done. It's been amazing being part of WOPA.
