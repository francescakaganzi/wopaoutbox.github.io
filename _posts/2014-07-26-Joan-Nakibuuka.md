##WOPA, THE FIRST COHORT
"What next?" is the question that lingered in my mind towards my four years of university education. When I heard of the opportunity to be a part of the WOPA programme, i did not look back. One of my best experiences was being accepted into the first cohort. Seven weeks have gone by and I have been able to learn a lot from the different mentors and the rest of the amazing ladies that are a part of this programme.

The self discovery week challenged me to look at life from a different point of view. I was left with so many questions that I alone have the answers to in order to achieve my life's mission. 

Getting into Human centered design has been one of the most exciting and challenging experiences so far. This is because much as I want to be a software developer, being able to analyse a problem and come up with a solution while focusing on the users' needs is an added advantage.

And ofcourse, the technical sessions have been more than ballistic, from the code to the candy and the assignments.
I am blessed to be a part of this and I hope to leave with lots of skills;both technical and social at the end of it all.
