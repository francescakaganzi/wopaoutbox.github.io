# Getting back home

God knows i could really use first the knowledge of driving and then a car. Getting back home can be quite something. I am tired, i could use some comfort travelling without worried about taxis and there availabity at 8:30 pm, suspecting every body walking around you as because its really dark. Well it gets better i know. Atleast i have the company of my friends up to the taxi park may be short but it makes a significant difference. Thanks every one. 

Same here getting back home is a bit scarey for me as well but with the company of my girl friends from WOPA class, i am safe. Before Zamda, Martina Joan and i used to go back with Evelyn because she had a car and took the same route as us. But even then the earliest i could home is 9:00pm.Though i do not like it, i dont seem to have many options. I joined WOPA, i love the sessions and i am ready to do everything to make it work.
