##The hyena and the hare

Once upon a time, at the edge of a wood pattern, there lived this clever hyena and the stupid hare. The hyena was so clever that he could easily fool the hare. One evening the hyena said to the hare, tomorrow I shall visit my in-laws in the village, so the hare agreed to go with him. They prepared for the journey, the hyena put grass in his bag and the hare also put grass in his bag. While they were going, he hare said, he was tired and decided to rest in someone’s farm.
