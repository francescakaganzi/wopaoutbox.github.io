##The hyena and the hare

Once upon a time, at the edge of a wood pattern, there lived this clever hyena and the stupid hare. The hyena was so clever that he could easily fool the hare. One evening the hyena said to the hare, tomorrow I shall visit my in-laws in the village, so the hare agreed to go with him. They prepared for the journey, the hyena put grass in his bag and the hare also put grass in his bag. While they were going, he hare said, he was tired and decided to rest in someoneâ€™s farm.

## A new year, a new beginning

When the clock struck midnight, the sky exploded in an array of colours. Fireworks popped all over the city and from our vantage point on top of Muyenga hill my friends and I had the best view. The New Year had rolled in and we were over the moon with excitement. What future was ahead of us? Hopefully this would be a better year. As we hugged and wished each other a blessed year I thought about what resolutions we would be making this time. And whether we would stick to them.
