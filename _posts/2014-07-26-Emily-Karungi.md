####THE WOMEN PASSION PROGRAM 2014

My name is Emily Karungi, I'm a tech enthusiast, I have a keen interest in the advancements being made in web technology, particularly on the front-end side of things. One of my biggest dreams is having a large number of girls join the tech community and I’m delighted to be a part the Women Passion Program. **The Women Passion Program** has not only equiped me with technical and business skills, but also changed the way I view life.



The WOPA *Business sessions* have so far been the most fascinating bit for me. I always heard of things like "The business canvas model", "Human Centered Design" and always thought they were just any ordinary terms that business folks use. Oh well, thanks to WOPA these business concepts now make sense to me. I like the way the sessions are conducted. Very practical, very hands on. Not like the ordinary boring university classes where lecturers stand in front of a class and talk for 2 hours non stop. With WOPA, the classes are very interactive and more of "Learning by doing." The business sessions have made me appreciate the work system analysts do and have made me realise that in order to become the super awesome developer I want to be, I need this business knowledge. Many thanks to the business team.

Now this is the most exciting bit. The *Technical Sessions!* It feels cool sitting in a room full of ladies that have the zeal to learn how to code. Just when I'm still scratching my head, trying to think about how to go about a problem, someone else has already come up with a solution. It is such great minds that make the sessions very interesting. Being able to offer a hand or share what I already know has helped me polish up my coding skills. I learn something new in every session, thanks to the facilitators and I am looking forward to learning more.
