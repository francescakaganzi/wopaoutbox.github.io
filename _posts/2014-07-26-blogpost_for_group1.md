# Getting back home

God knows i could really use first the knowledge of driving and then a car. Getting back home can be quite something. I am tired, i could use some comfort travelling without worried about taxis and there availabity at 8:30 pm, suspecting every body walking around you as because its really dark. Well it gets better i know. Atleast i have the company of my friends up to the taxi park may be short but it makes a significant difference. Thanks every one.
