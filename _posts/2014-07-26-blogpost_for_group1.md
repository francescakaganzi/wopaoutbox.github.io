## The price  of sacrifice
There once lived a very loving lady who always went an extra mile to give a hand and serve others.  It didn’t matter whether she was helping a stranger or a friend, her peace and satisfaction was derived from relieving others of their pain.  One time she met a man hit by a car on the road side.   To her surprise people around the scene were just gazing, no one was bothering to take him to hospital. With a lot of disappointment, she opened her car and tried to carry the man but she realized he was too heavy for her to carry. On asking for help, the bystanders reminded her that they don’t want to be accused of being responsible of the accident. She gathered her strength all at once and carried the man to her car. Thereafter she hurriedly got into the driver’s seat and drove off to see that she gets this man to the hospital in the shortest time possible.

On reaching the hospital, no one was willing to help her carry the patient to the casuality room. "What happeneed to humanity?!" she mumbled. Everyone was minding their own business. Bravely, she managed to get the man to the ward but to her suprise, the doctors and the nurses there did not give any attention to the patient. "Can someone help this man please! He is in critical condition" she shouted.
