           ## The amazing WOPA program

Seven weeks ago I joined the Women Passion program (WOPA). I was excited and anxious all at the same time. 
Excited because I was going to meet many new people, learn great stuff and beef up my CV. Anxious because I did not know if I would handle the technical stuff considering I have not done any computer training beyond the basics. 
I was also worried that the other commitments in my life would derail me from the program.
We are now slightly more than halfway through the program and all my anxieties have been dissipated. 
The amazing women on the program (instructors and fellow learners) have helped me push myself to the maximum. Their passion is contagious, their intelligence palpable. Their excitement, humour and enthusiasm help me overcome any stress or fatigue to concentrate on the two and a half hour long classes that we have thrice a week. 
Iâ€™m glad I was chosen to be in the first cohort of this amazing program!
